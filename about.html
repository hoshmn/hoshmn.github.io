	<p class="about">

Studying cognitive science at UC Berkeley tuned me in to the ways we perceive, learn from, and interact with others and the world around us. It also taught me to think analytically and communicate clearly, and introduced me to computer science as a powerful tool for modeling and simulating cognition (through computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence). I learned functional programming in Scheme and the basic tenets of computer science.

After graduating, I worked in mental health and international education before being drawn back to the inventive nature of programming. I taught myself Python and machine learning before deciding to accelerate my learning process through an immersive software engineering bootcamp. I attended the rigorous Fullstack Academy, where I learned full-stack JavaScript: node, express, postgres/sequelize, and react/redux. Along with my capstone team, I built

After finishing, I was selected to work for Fullstack for an additional 4 months as a teaching fellow. During this time, I worked on an internal engineering project building a VR whiteboard for remote students to practice whiteboarding problems.

I'm currently looking to apply myself to a meaningful, stimulating project. I hope to work alongside other driven and compassionate individuals on a team that's large enough to provide some degree of mentorship but small enough that my voice is heard and actually has an impact on the trajectory of the work. My expertise is currently in full stack JavaScript, but I'm a quick learner and am excited to add more tools to my toolkit!
